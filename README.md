## Summary
    
- Calculate the lower bounds for the leading eigenvalues of the Laplacian by using the non-conforming finite element method. 

- The Crouzeix-Rarviart (CR) finite element method is used to provide lower eigenvalue bounds; such a method even works for non-convex domains.

- The lower and upper eigenvalue bounds for an L-shaped domain are also given at the end of notebook file.
